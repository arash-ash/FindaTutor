This project is about designing and implementing and Android application that solves the challenge of connecting students and tutors together. The idea is that tutors can post “ads” for a particular course and students can request a “session” after checking the price, ratings, reviews, the course topics, schedule and the location of the tutor. However, only after tutors accept the request, students can contact the tutors in the chat session created. Also students can post “ads” for needing private lessons for a particular subject and then tutors can request for a “session”. In both cases however, the tutor will be terminating the sessions after the lesson is finished and then a notification will be sent to the student to rate the tutor.

In order to compile the project in Android Studio, the SDK tool level 24 is required. In addion, the emulator or the physical device used to run the project needs to be at least running API level 10.

Project Status: the application is currently at version 0.6. Authentication and Ads display and create is complete in addition to messaging and session create. Notifications and session hadnling is partially complete. The settings, statistics and profile is incomplete.
